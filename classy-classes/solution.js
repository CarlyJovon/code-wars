//Your task is to complete the Person class. It should have a constructor that accepts a person's name as string and a person's age as integer.
//It should also have an info / Info (C#) property/getter/accessor/field (depending on your language) which should evaluate to a formatted string like "johns age is 34", using the person's age and name.

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name; 
    this.age = age;
  }
  
  get info () { 
  return `${this.name}s age is ${this.age}`;
}
